# Jayked dotfiles
For quick configuration of preferences I put the configuration in these dotfiles to sync them over all my environments.

## Configuration
Clone the repository in the home folder of your user and starting the installation:
```
git clone https://github.com/jayked/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
./bootstrap
```
You can re-install by cd-ing to the `.dotfiles` directory and running the following command:
```
./bootstrap
```
